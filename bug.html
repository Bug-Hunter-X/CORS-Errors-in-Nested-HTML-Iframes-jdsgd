<p>This is an example of an uncommon HTML bug related to nested iframes and cross-origin resource sharing (CORS).</p> <p>Consider the following HTML structure:</p> <pre><code> &lt;iframe src="https://example.com/iframe1.html"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt; &lt;iframe src="https://another-example.com/iframe2.html"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt; </code></pre> <p>If <code>iframe1.html</code> attempts to access resources from <code>iframe2.html</code> (or vice-versa), it might encounter a CORS error, even if both iframes are hosted on different domains. This is because browsers impose strict security rules to prevent unauthorized data access between different origins.</p> <p>The problem is exacerbated by the fact that this issue is not always immediately obvious, especially when dealing with complex nested iframe structures or dynamic content loading.</p>
